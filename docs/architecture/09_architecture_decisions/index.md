# Architecture Decisions {#section-design-decisions}

We use _architecture decision records (ADR)_ to [document our architecture decissions][adr-nygard]. We adopted the [template][adr-template] from [Joel Parker Henderson][gh-henderson].

You find all ADRs in the sidebar below this section. They are numbered and ordered in their time of emergence.
