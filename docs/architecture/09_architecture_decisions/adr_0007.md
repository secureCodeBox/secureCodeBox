**NOTE**: The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Context

The secureCodeBox should support the possibility to find duplicate findings easily out of the box. 
One use case is that a user want to accept a existing finding and want to ignore the same finding in the future.

### Assumptions

- The execution order of *hooks* is unspecified.
- The information if a finding’s *hash* is a duplicate MUST NOT be stored or maintained in the *SCB* S3 storage.
- The *SCB* MUST NOT remove findings: *read-write-hooks* may alter them, but never delete or filter them out.
  - Maybe a *read-hooks* MAY decide to not store a finding into an external system.

## Decision

- We generate a hash for each finding, so we can compare findings by the hash and identify duplicates.
- This hash MUST be mutable and MAY be altered by *read-write-hooks* because we don’t want to introduce an exception to what a *read-write-hooks* can alter.
- The *parser* MUST generate the initial hash of a finding from some of its attributes (e.g. name, location, category …).
  - Each *scanner* MUST define a default set of attributes used for the hashing.
  - This set of hashed attributes MAY be overwritten.
- Each *read-write-hook* MUST update the hash as last step because the *hook* MAY change a hashed attribute.

We implement the hashing step in the *parser* first with feature flag to evaluate this proposal.

## Consequences

- We don’t need to introduce an ordering for the *read-write-hooks*.
- The duplicate detection/handling MUST be done in another service with its own data storage. This is because we have no stable hash until the *read-hooks* will be executed and these MUST NOT alter the data in *SCB* itself. But the *read-hooks* MAY decide to not store data into an external system.
