Now that you have installed the secureCodeBox, you can start you are close to being able to run your first scans.

Before we can start scans, we need to install their `ScanTypes`, these tell the secureCodeBox Operator how to run the scans and how their results can be parsed to create a uniform and consistent finding data model. ScanTypes are namespaced [Custom Resource Definitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/) in Kubernetes, this lets different teams operating in different namespaces use different types of scanners and enables them to define their own custom ScanTypes.

## Installing the Nmap ScanType

In this guide, we'll use the [Nmap Port & Network Scanner](https://nmap.org), as it is fast and relatively easy to use. We can install the Nmap ScanType via Helm (Make sure to add the helm repo first. See [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)):

```bash
helm install nmap secureCodeBox/nmap
```

To verify or to see which ScanTypes are installed in your current Namespace you can run:

```bash
kubectl get scantypes
```

This should print an output like this (your version might differ):

```text
NAME     IMAGE
nmap     docker.io/securecodebox/scanner-nmap:7.91-r0
```

## Starting a Scan

Now that we have the ScanType Nmap installed, we are ready to start our first scan.

This example creates a Nmap scan which probes the [scanme.nmap.org](http://scanme.nmap.org) host. This scan is equivalent to running `nmap scanme.nmap.org` locally.

:::caution
Please note the terms of usage for the [http://scanme.nmap.org/](http://scanme.nmap.org/) website.
Basically, restrict yourself to run portscans and don't run crazy amounts of scans against it.
:::

```yaml title="nmap-scan.yaml"
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "nmap-scanme.nmap.org"
spec:
  scanType: "nmap"
  parameters:
    - scanme.nmap.org
```

To run this example save the YAML above to a local file named `nmap-scan.yaml` and then start the scan via kubectl:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nmap-scan.yaml
```

The scan is now starting up, you can track its progress using kubectl:

```bash
kubectl get scans
```

This should print an output like this:

```text
NAME                   TYPE   STATE      FINDINGS
nmap-scanme.nmap.org   nmap   Scanning
```

## Monitoring the Scan Execution

When you apply a scan, the secureCodeBox Operator will create a [Kubernetes Job](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/) in your namespace. In this namespace, the scanner (in our example the Nmap scanner) will be executed inside a container. Once the scan has completed the container will terminate and no compute resources will be consumed anymore. You can view the status of this job by running:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

This should give you an output like this

```text
NAME                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
parse-nmap-scanme.nmap.org-h8thd   1/1           30s        43m
scan-nmap-scanme.nmap.org-w66rp    1/1           10s        25s
```

:::note
Your job names will be slightly different. Kubernetes generates a random suffix for each job name to make them unique. In our case the suffix fir the scan job is `-w66rp` and for the parse job is `-h8thd`.
:::

You can also view the logs of the container by running:

```bash
kubectl logs job/scan-nmap-scanme.nmap.org-w66rp nmap
```

If your job is still running you can stream the logs of the scan until it has completed:

```bash
kubectl logs job/scan-nmap-scanme.nmap.org-w66rp nmap --follow
```

This should print an output like this:

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-09-25 10:50 UTC
Nmap scan report for scanme.nmap.org (45.33.32.156)
Host is up (0.19s latency).
Other addresses for scanme.nmap.org (not scanned): 2600:3c01::f03c:91ff:fe18:bb2f
Not shown: 993 closed ports
PORT      STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp    open     ssh

139/tcp   filtered netbios-ssn
445/tcp   filtered microsoft-ds
9929/tcp  open     nping-echo
31337/tcp open     Elite

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 5.44 seconds
```

Unless you are really quick or your scan took a long time you'll likely also seen that a second job was started:

```bash
kubectl get jobs
```

This should print an output like this:

```text
NAME                               COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
parse-nmap-scanme.nmap.org-sl56z   1/1           14s        15s
scan-nmap-scanme.nmap.org-w66rp    1/1           10s        25s
```

This second job takes the result of the Nmap Scan and transforms them into a secureCodeBox specific finding format. These findings share the same basic structure for all integrated scanners, which makes it very convenient to analyze them in further steps.

## Viewing the Scan Results

Once this second job has completed you can get an overview of the results by taking another look at the scan:

```bash
kubectl get scans
```

This should print an output like this:

```text
NAME                   TYPE   STATE   FINDINGS
nmap-scanme.nmap.org   nmap   Done    8
```

This list shows us the total count of findings identified by the scan. You can get a deeper overview by running:

```bash
kubectl describe scan nmap-scanme.nmap.org
```

This should print an output like this:

```yaml {19-25}

This gives us an overview of the results of the scan.
To view the actual findings produced by the scan you can use the download link to download the findings as JSON from MinIO/S3.

:::note
When using the default MinIO installation, you'll need to port-forward the to be able to access the finding download link. See: [installation](/docs/getting-started/installation#accessing-the-included-minio-instance)

## Next Steps

### Configure more Involved Nmap Scans

Nmap is an extremely powerful tool, which can be used for much more than just scanning for ports.
You can find more examples of Nmap scans, including example findings for these scans on the documentation page of the [Nmap ScanType](/docs/scanners/Nmap).

### Other ScanTypes

Nmap is just one of the many security testing tools integrated into the secureCodeBox, you can find examples and documentation on how to use each of them on their documentation page in the sidebar.

To get started you can also take a look at our more [detailed guides](/docs/how-tos)

### Pushing Findings into External Systems

You can also integrate the secureCodeBox to automatically push the scan results into an external system like [Elasticsearch](/docs/hooks/Elasticsearch) or [DefectDojo](/docs/hooks/DefectDojo) to better analyse your findings.
