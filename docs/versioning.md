# Versioning

All components of the secureCodeBox use [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, we increment the:

- MAJOR version when we make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when we make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Maintaining compatible versions

Backend components will always remain compatible due to ongoing the availability of old API versions.

## Changelogs

Changelogs can be found the in release notes attached to git tags, e.g. (https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox-v2/releases).
