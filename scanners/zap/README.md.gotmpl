The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers*. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing.

## Deployment

The ZAP scanType can be deployed via helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install zap secureCodeBox/zap
```

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the ZAP Docker Scan Scripts. By default the secureCodeBox ZAP Helm Chart installs all three ZAP scripts: `zap-baseline`, `zap-full-scan` & `zap-api-scan`. Listed below are the arguments supported by the `zap-baseline` script, which are mostly interchangable with the other ZAP scripts. For a more complete reference check out the [ZAP Documentation](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/docker/) and the secureCodeBox based ZAP examples listed below.

The command line interface can be used to easily run server scans: `-t www.example.com`

```bash
Usage: zap-baseline.py -t <target> [options]
    -t target         target URL including the protocol, eg https://www.example.com
Options:
    -h                print this help message
    -c config_file    config file to use to INFO, IGNORE or FAIL warnings
    -u config_url     URL of config file to use to INFO, IGNORE or FAIL warnings
    -g gen_file       generate default config file (all rules set to WARN)
    -m mins           the number of minutes to spider for (default 1)
    -r report_html    file to write the full ZAP HTML report
    -w report_md      file to write the full ZAP Wiki (Markdown) report

    -P                specify listen port
    -D                delay in seconds to wait for passive scanning
    -i                default rules not in the config file to INFO
    -I                do not return failure on warning
    -j                use the Ajax spider in addition to the traditional one
