Git-Repo-Scanner is a small Python script which discovers repositories on GitHub or GitLab. The main purpose of this scanner
is to provide a cascading input for the [gitleaks](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/scanners/gitleaks).
 scanner.


## Deployment

The  git-repo-scanner can be deployed with helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install gitleaks secureCodeBox/git-repo-scanner
```

## Scanner configuration

The scanner options can be divided into two groups for gitlab and github. You can choose the git
repository type with the option:

```bash
--git-type github
or
--git-type gitlab
```

#### GitHub
For type GitHub you can use the following options:
- `--organization`: The name of the GitHub organization you want to scan.
- `--url`: The url of the api for a GitHub enterprise server. Skip this option for repos on <https://github.com>.
- `--access-token`: Your personal GitHub access token.
- `--ignore-repos`: A list of GitHub repository ids you want to ignore
- `--obey-rate-limit`: True to obey the rate limit of the GitHub server (default), otherwise False
- `--activity-since-duration`: Return git repo findings with repo activity (e.g. commits) more recent than a specific date expresed by an duration (now + duration). A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
                               with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '1h' or '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w'.
- `--activity-until-duration`: Return git repo findings with repo activity (e.g. commits) older than a specific date expresed by an duration (now + duration). A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with
                               optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '1h' or '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w'.

For now only organizations are supported so the option is mandatory. We **strongly recommend** providing an access token
for authentication. If not provided the rate limiting will kick in after about 30 repositories scanned.

#### GitLab
For type GitLab you can use the following options:
- `--url`: The url of the GitLab server.
- `--access-token`: Your personal GitLab access token.
- `--group`: A specific GitLab group id you want to san, including subgroups.
- `--ignore-groups`: A list of GitLab group ids you want to ignore
- `--ignore-repos`: A list of GitLab project ids you want to ignore
- `--obey-rate-limit`: True to obey the rate limit of the GitLab server (default), otherwise False
- `--activity-since-duration`: Return git repo findings with repo activity (e.g. commits) more recent than a specific date expresed by an duration (now + duration). A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each
                               with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '1h' or '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w'.
- `--activity-until-duration`: Return git repo findings with repo activity (e.g. commits) older than a specific date expresed by an duration (now + duration). A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with
                               optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as '1h' or '2h45m'. Valid time units are 'm', 'h', 'd', 'w'.


For gitlab the url and the access token is mandatory. If you don't provide a specific group id all projects
on the gitlab server are going to be discovered.
