## What is Trivy?

`Trivy` (`tri` pronounced like **tri**gger, `vy` pronounced like en**vy**) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.
A software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or weakness present in the software or in an Operating System.
`Trivy` detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.).
`Trivy` is easy to use. Just install the binary, and you're ready to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target such as an image name of the container.

To learn more about the Trivy scanner itself visit [Trivy's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).

## Deployment
The trivy chart can be deployed via helm:

```bash
# Install HelmChart (use -n to configure another namespace)
helm upgrade --install trivy secureCodeBox/trivy
```

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [Trivy Documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/), please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

### Trivy Container Image Scan

Currently we support the follwing 3 scanTypes, corresponding to the trivy scanning modes:
- scanType: "trivy-image"
   - parameters: `[YOUR_IMAGE_NAME]`
- scanType: "trivy-filesystem"
   - parameters: `[YOUR_PATH_TO_FILES]`
- scanType: "trivy-repo"
   - parameters: `[YOUR_GITHUB_REPO]`

A complete example of each scanType are listed below in our [example docs section](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/trivy/#examples).

Simply specify an image name (and a tag) when you use the scanType `trivy-image`. But there are also some additional configuration options e.g:
- Filter the vulnerabilities by severities `--severity HIGH,CRITICAL ruby:2.4.0`
- Filter the vulnerabilities by type (`os` or `library`) `--vuln-type os ruby:2.4.0`
- Skip update of vulnerability DB: `--skip-update python:3.4-alpine3.9`
- Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities:`--ignore-unfixed ruby:2.4.0` By default, Trivy also detects unpatched/unfixed vulnerabilities. This means you can't fix these vulnerabilities even if you update all packages. If you would like to ignore them, use the `--ignore-unfixed` option.

A complete scan definition for the secureCodeBox repository may look something like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "trivy-scb"
spec:
  scanType: "trivy-image"
  parameters:
    - bkimminich/juice-shop:v10.2.0
```

### Scanning Many Targets
By default, the docker container of trivy will download new rulesets when starting the process.
As this download is performed directly from GitHub, you will run into API rate limiting issues after roughly 50 requests.
Trivy [supports a client-server mode](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/advanced/modes/client-server/) where one process downloads a copy of the rule database and provides it to the others.
Due to [limitations in trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/634), this mode currently only supports scanning container images.
If this fits your use case, you can deploy a rule service with the following template:
```yaml
# First declare a service that will serve requests to the rule pod
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: trivy-rules
  # Update the namespace here if you are using a different one
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: trivy-rules
spec:
  selector:
    app: trivy-rules
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  type: ClusterIP
---
# Now declare the actual deployment of the rule server
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: trivy-rules
  # Again, update the namespace here
  namespace: default
  labels:
    app: trivy-rules
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: trivy-rules
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: trivy-rules
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: trivy-rules
        # Don't forget to set this to a version matching that used in secureCodeBox
        image: aquasec/trivy:0.20.2
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        args:
        - "server"
        - "--listen"
        - "0.0.0.0:8080"
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
```

You can then start scans of images using the client mode. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "test-trivy"
  # Don't forget to update the namespace if necessary
  namespace: default
spec:
  scanType: "trivy-image"
  parameters:
    - "client"
    # Again, add the extra parameters here (required to make the parser work)
    # But don't add the --no-progress switch.
    - "--format"
    - "json"
    - "--output"
    - "/home/securecodebox/trivy-results.json"
    # Specify the rule service internal DNS name here.
    # (Substitute a different namespace if you changed it)
    - "--remote"
    - "http://trivy-rules.default.svc:8080"
    # Finally, specify the image you want to scan
    - "securecodebox/operator:3.0.0"
```

If you want to scan anything other than docker images, you currently [cannot use the client-server mode](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/issues/634) described above.
Instead, you have to [manually download the ruleset and provide it to trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/advanced/air-gap/).
In practice, this is a difficult problem because the most natural method for providing these files in kubernetes, ConfigMaps, has a size limit of 1 MB, while the vulnerability database is over 200 MB in size (28 MB after compression).
Your best bet would thus be to serve the files from your own servers and load them into the scanner [using an initContainer](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/scan#initcontainers-optional), taking care to keep the databases on your server up to date.
Consult the [trivy documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/advanced/air-gap/) for additional details on the required steps.
