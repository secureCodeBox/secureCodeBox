`Trivy` (`tri` pronounced like **tri**gger, `vy` pronounced like en**vy**) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.
A software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or weakness present in the software or in an Operating System.
`Trivy` detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.).
`Trivy` is easy to use. Just install the binary and you're ready to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target such as an image name of the container.

To learn more about the Trivy scanner itself visit on [Trivy's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).

## Deployment

The Trivy scanType can be deployed via helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install trivy secureCodeBox/trivy
```

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [Trivy Documentation], please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

- Filter the vulnerabilities by severities `trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL ruby:2.4.0`
- Filter the vulnerabilities by type (`os` or `library`) `trivy image --vuln-type os ruby:2.4.0`
- Skip update of vulnerability DB: `trivy image --skip-update python:3.4-alpine3.9`
- Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities:`trivy image --ignore-unfixed ruby:2.4.0` By default, Trivy also detects unpatched/unfixed vulnerabilities. This means you can't fix these vulnerabilities even if you update all packages. If you would like to ignore them, use the `--ignore-unfixed` option.
