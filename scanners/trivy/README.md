## What is Trivy?

`Trivy` (`tri` pronounced like **tri**gger, `vy` pronounced like en**vy**) is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers and other artifacts.
A software vulnerability is a glitch, flaw, or weakness present in the software or in an Operating System.
`Trivy` detects vulnerabilities of OS packages (Alpine, RHEL, CentOS, etc.) and application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, npm, yarn, etc.).
`Trivy` is easy to use. Just install the binary, and you're ready to scan. All you need to do for scanning is to specify a target such as an image name of the container.

To learn more about the Trivy scanner itself visit [Trivy's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).

## Deployment
The trivy chart can be deployed via helm:

```bash
# Install HelmChart (use -n to configure another namespace)
helm upgrade --install trivy oci://ghcr.io/securecodebox/helm/trivy
```

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [Trivy Documentation](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/), please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

### Trivy Container Image Scan

Currently we support the follwing 4 scanTypes, corresponding to the trivy scanning modes:
- scanType: "trivy-image"
   - parameters: `[YOUR_IMAGE_NAME]`
- scanType: "trivy-filesystem"
   - parameters: `[YOUR_PATH_TO_FILES]`
- scanType: "trivy-repo"
   - parameters: `[YOUR_GITHUB_REPO]`
- scanType: "trivy-k8s"
   - parameters: `[KUBERNETES_RESOURCE]`

A complete example of each scanType are listed below in our [example docs section](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/trivy/#examples).

Simply specify an image name (and a tag) when you use the scanType `trivy-image`. But there are also some additional configuration options e.g:
- Filter the vulnerabilities by severities `--severity HIGH,CRITICAL ruby:2.4.0`
- Filter the vulnerabilities by type (`os` or `library`) `--vuln-type os ruby:2.4.0`
- Skip update of vulnerability DB: `--skip-update python:3.4-alpine3.9`
- Ignore unfixed vulnerabilities:`--ignore-unfixed ruby:2.4.0` By default, Trivy also detects unpatched/unfixed vulnerabilities. This means you can't fix these vulnerabilities even if you update all packages. If you would like to ignore them, use the `--ignore-unfixed` option.

A complete scan definition for the secureCodeBox repository may look something like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "trivy-scb"
spec:
  scanType: "trivy-image"
  parameters:
    - bkimminich/juice-shop:v10.2.0
```

### Scanning Many Targets
By default, the docker container of trivy will download the vulnerability database when starting the process.
As this download is performed directly from GitHub, you will run into API rate limiting issues after roughly 50 requests.
Trivy [supports a client-server mode](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/references/modes/client-server/) where one process downloads a copy of the vulnerability database and provides it to the others.

This mode is implemented and active by default.
A separate Deployment for the trivy server will be created during the installation and the trivy scanTypes are automatically configured to run in client mode and connect to the server.

:::caution

Client/server mode is not used for `trivy-k8s` scans, because trivy does not support it for this type of scan.
If you start many `trivy-k8s` scans you might run into rate limits.
One way to avoid that is to [preemptively download](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/advanced/air-gap/) the trivy database once and then provide it similar to how the [nuclei template cache](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/nuclei/#install-nuclei-without-template-cache-cronjob--persistentvolume) is handled.
:::

In case only a single scan or very few are run, and you want to avoid the small performance overhead, client/server mode can be disabled by setting `--set="trivyDatabaseCache.enabled=false"` during helm install.
