## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `v1.1.1`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/typo3scan].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-typo3scan
```

## What is Typo3Scan?
Typo3Scan is an open source penetration testing tool, that automates the process of detecting the Typo3 CMS version and its installed extensions. It also has a database with known vulnerabilities for core and extensions.
The vulnerabilities corresponding to the version detected are presented as findings.
To learn more about the Typo3Scan scanner itself, visit the Typo3Scan GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/whoot/Typo3Scan).

## Scanner Configuration

The Typo3Scan target is specified with the `-d` parameter. The target should be a url, hostname or an IP address.
:::caution
Please note that, the target url has to start with http:// or https:// when using a hostname or IP address as a target for the scan to work correctly.
For example: `http://localhost` or `https://123.45.67.890:80`
:::

Additional Typo3Scan scan features can be configured via the parameter attribute.

Some useful example parameters listed below:

- `--vuln` : Check for extensions with known vulnerabilities only.
- `--timeout TIMEOUT` : Request Timeout. Default: 10 seconds
- `--auth USER:PASS`: Username and Password for HTTP Basic Authorization.
- `--cookie NAME=VALUE`: Can be used for authenticiation based on cookies.
- `--agent USER-AGENT`: Set custom User-Agent for requests.
- `--threads THREADS`: The number of threads to use for enumerating extensions. Default: 5
- `--json`: Output results to json file
- `--force`: Force enumeration
- `--no-interaction`: Do not ask any interactive question
