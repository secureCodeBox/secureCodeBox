## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `0.21.0`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/kubeaudit].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-kubeaudit
```

## What is Kubeaudit?
Kubeaudit finds security misconfigurations in you Kubernetes Resources and gives tips on how to resolve these.

Kubeaudit comes with a large lists of "auditors" which test various aspects, like the SecurityContext of pods.
You can find the complete list of [auditors here](https://github.com/Shopify/kubeaudit/tree/master/docs/auditors).

To learn more about the kubeaudit itself visit [kubeaudit GitHub].

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [kube-hunter Documentation], please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

* To specify remote machines for hunting, select option 1 or use the --remote option. Example: `kube-hunter --remote some.node.com`
* To specify interface scanning, you can use the --interface option (this will scan all the machine's network interfaces). Example: `kube-hunter --interface`
* To specify a specific CIDR to scan, use the --cidr option. Example: `kube-hunter --cidr 192.168.0.0/24`
