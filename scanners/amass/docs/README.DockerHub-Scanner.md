## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on Kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Notice
This image is a workaround for the official Amass docker image, older amass versions are regularly removed from the official docker registry, this is often breaks our builds.
To prevent this we create a new image based on the official one and push it to our docker registry.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `3.0.0`, `2.9.0`, `2.8.0`, `2.7.0`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/Amass].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-amass
```

## What is OWASP Amass?

:::caution
Amass currently has a [known issue](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/issues/918) where the enumeration sometimes does not exit correctly and keeps running indefinitely. This is why we recommend using the option `-timeout MINUTES` mitigate the issue. The scan will then exit after the specified amount of minutes, and the findings should be correctly parsed.  
:::

The [OWASP Amass Project][owasp_amass_project] has developed a tool to help information security professionals perform network mapping of attack surfaces and perform external asset discovery using open source information gathering and active reconnaissance techniques. To learn more about the Amass scanner itself visit [OWASP Amass Project][owasp_amass_project] or [Amass GitHub].

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [Amass User Guide](https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass/blob/master/doc/user_guide.md#the-enum-subcommand), please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

- The most basic use of the tool for subdomain enumeration: `amass enum -d example.com`
- Typical parameters for DNS enumeration: `amass enum -v -brute -min-for-recursive 2 -d example.com`

Special command line options:

- Enable generation of altered names `amass enum -alts -d example.com`
- Turn off recursive brute forcing `amass enum -brute -norecursive -d example.com`
- Domain names separated by commas (can be used multiple times) `amass enum -d example.com`
