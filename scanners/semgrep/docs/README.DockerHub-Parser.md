## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `1.9.0`

## How to use this image
This `parser` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding security scanner docker image to parse the `findings` results. For more information details please take a look at the documentation page: https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/semgrep.

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/parser-semgrep
```

## What is Semgrep?
Semgrep ("semantic grep") is a static source code analyzer that can be used to search for specific patterns in code.
It allows you to either [write your own rules](https://semgrep.dev/learn), or use one of the [many pre-defined rulesets](https://semgrep.dev/r) curated by the semgrep team.

To learn more about semgrep, visit [semgrep.dev](https://semgrep.dev).
