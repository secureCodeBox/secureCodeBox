## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## What is Ncrack?
Ncrack is a high-speed network authentication cracking tool. It was built to help companies secure their networks by proactively testing all their hosts and networking devices for poor passwords. Security professionals also rely on Ncrack when auditing their clients. Ncrack was designed using a modular approach, a command-line syntax similar to Nmap and a dynamic engine that can adapt its behaviour based on network feedback. It allows for rapid, yet reliable large-scale auditing of multiple hosts.

To learn more about the Ncrack scanner itself visit [Ncrack GitHub] or [Ncrack Website].

## Deployment
The ncrack chart can be deployed via helm:

```bash
# Install HelmChart (use -n to configure another namespace)
helm upgrade --install ncrack secureCodeBox/ncrack
```

## Scanner Configuration

The following security scan configuration example are based on the [Ncrack Documentation], please take a look at the original documentation for more configuration examples.

This options summary is printed when Ncrack is run with no arguments. It helps people remember the most common options, but is no substitute for the in-depth documentation in the rest of this manual.

## Requirements

## Additional Chart Configurations
### Ncrack Deployment & Configuration

#### Password encryption

Because **Ncrack** findings are very sensitive, you probably don't want every *secureCodeBox* user to see them. In order
to address this issue we provide an option that lets you encrypt found passwords with public key crypto. Just
generate a key pair with openssl:

```bash
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in key.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
```

After you created the public key file you have to create a kubernetes secret from that
file:
```bash
  kubectl create secret generic --from-file="public.key=public.pem" <ncrack-secret-name>
```
Now you only need to set the value *encryptPasswords.existingSecret* to the
secrets name when installing the scanner

```bash
  helm install ncrack secureCodeBox/ncrack --set="encryptPasswords.existingSecret=<ncrack-secret-name>"
```

To decrypt a password from a finding use:

```bash
base64 encryptedPassword -d | openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey key.pem -out decryptedPassword.txt
```

#### Setup with custom files:
If you want to use your own files within the Ncrack scan, you have to create a secret first:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic --from-file users.txt --from-file passwords.txt ncrack-lists
```

<b> IMPORTANT: Use an extra empty line at the end of your files, otherwise the last letter of the last line will be omitted (due to a bug in k8) </b>

Now we created a secret named "ncrack-lists".
Before we can use the files, we have to install the Ncrack ScanType:

```bash
cat <<EOF | helm install ncrack ./scanners/ncrack --values -
scanner:
  extraVolumes:
    - name: ncrack-lists
      secret:
        secretName: ncrack-lists
  extraVolumeMounts:
    - name: ncrack-lists
      mountPath: "/ncrack/"
EOF
```

This enables us now to refer to our files via `/ncrack/<file>` in the scan.yaml.

For a full example on how to configure Ncrack with your custom files against a ssh service, see the "dummy-ssh" example.

#### Basic setup (no files can be mounted):

The Ncrack ScanType can be deployed via helm:

```bash
helm upgrade --install ncrack secureCodeBox/ncrack
```

#### Delete Ncrack ScanType:

```bash
helm delete ncrack
```
