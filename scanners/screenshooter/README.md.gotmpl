This integration takes screenshots of websites. This can be extremely helpful when you are using the secureCodeBox to scan a large number of services and want to get a quick visual overview of each service.

## Deployment

The scanType can be deployed via helm.

```bash
helm upgrade --install screenshooter ./scanners/screenshooter/
```

### Configuration

You have to provide only the URL to the screenshooter. Be careful, the protocol is mandatory:
* `https://secureCodeBox.io`
* **not** `secureCodeBox.io` or `www.secureCodeBox.io`
