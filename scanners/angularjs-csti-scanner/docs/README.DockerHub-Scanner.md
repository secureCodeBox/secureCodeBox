## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `null`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/angularjs-csti-scanner].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-angularjs-csti-scanner
```

## What is AngularJS Client-Side Template Injection Scanner (acstis)?

The AngularJS Client-Side Template Injection Scanner (acstis) is an open source scanner for
finding possible template injection vulnerabilities on websites using AngularJS.

For more information visit the projects [GitHub site][acstis-github].

## Scanner Configuration

The only mandatory parameter is:
- `-d`: The url to scan (e.g. https://angularjs.org/).

Optional arguments:

```bash
-c, --crawl                                                                      use the crawler to scan all the entire domain
-vp, --verify-payload                                                            use a javascript engine to verify if the payload was executed (otherwise false positives may occur)
-av ANGULAR_VERSION, --angular-version ANGULAR_VERSION                           manually pass the angular version (e.g. 1.4.2) if the automatic check doesn't work
-vrl VULNERABLE_REQUESTS_LOG, --vulnerable-requests-log VULNERABLE_REQUESTS_LOG  log all vulnerable requests to this file (e.g. /var/logs/acstis.log or urls.log)
-siv, --stop-if-vulnerable                                                       (crawler option) stop scanning if a vulnerability was found
-pmm, --protocol-must-match                                                      (crawler option) only scan pages with the same protocol as the starting point (e.g. only https)
-sos, --scan-other-subdomains                                                    (crawler option) also scan pages that have another subdomain than the starting point
-soh, --scan-other-hostnames                                                     (crawler option) also scan pages that have another hostname than the starting point
-sot, --scan-other-tlds                                                          (crawler option) also scan pages that have another tld than the starting point
-md MAX_DEPTH, --max-depth MAX_DEPTH                                             (crawler option) the maximum search depth (default is unlimited)
-mt MAX_THREADS, --max-threads MAX_THREADS                                       (crawler option) the maximum amount of simultaneous threads to use (default is 20)
-iic, --ignore-invalid-certificates                                              (crawler option) ignore invalid ssl certificates
```

**Do not** override the option `-vrl` or `--vulnerable-requests-log`. It is already configured for automatic findings parsing.
