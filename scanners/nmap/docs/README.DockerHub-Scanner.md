## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on Kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `7.92-r2`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/Nmap].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-nmap
```

## What is NMAP?
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

To learn more about the Nmap scanner itself visit [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/).

## NSE scripts

Currently, the secureCodeBox Nmap parser supports the `smb-protocols`, `ftp-anon`, and `ftp-banner` script with compatibility for hostrules and portrules. If you want custom scripts to be parsed by secureCodeBox, you may contribute your script parser in `parser/parser.js` under `const scriptParser`

```javascript
const scriptParser = {
  "ftp-anon": parseFtpAnon,
  "banner": parseBanner,
  "smb-protocols": parseSmbProtocols,
  [...] // Contributed custom parsers
}
```

Scripts without an existing parser will only generate an open port finding. Scripts with parsers will add a script output finding.

## Scanner Configuration

The Nmap scan targets are specified as the last parameter. The target should be a hostname, an IP address or an IP range. See [Nmap Docs](https://nmap.org/book/man-target-specification.html) for details.

Additional Nmap scan features can be configured via the parameter attribute. For a detailed explanation to which parameters are available refer to the [Nmap Reference Guide](https://nmap.org/book/man.html). All parameters are supported, but be careful with parameters that require root level rights, as these require additional configuration on the ScanType to be supported.

Some useful example parameters listed below:

- `-p` xx: Scan ports of the target. Replace xx with a single port number or a range of ports.
- `-PS`, `-PA`, `-PU` xx: Replace xx with the ports to scan. TCP SYN/ACK or
  UDP discovery.
- `-sV`: Determine service and version info.
- `-O`: Determine OS info. **Note:** This requires that Nmap is run as root, or that the user has the system capabilities to be extended to allow Nmap to send raw sockets. See more information on [how to deploy the secureCodeBox nmap container to allow this](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/scanner-infrastructure-nmap/pull/20) and the [nmap docs about privileged scans](https://secwiki.org/w/Running_nmap_as_an_unprivileged_user)
- `-A`: Determine service/version and OS info.
- `-script` xx: Replace xx with the script name. Start the scan with the given script.
- `--script` xx: Replace xx with a coma-separated list of scripts. Start the scan with the given scripts.
