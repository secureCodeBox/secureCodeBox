## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `v2.0.0`

## How to use this image
This `scanner` image is intended to work in combination with the corresponding `parser` image to parse the scanner `findings` to generic secureCodeBox results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/ffuf].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/scanner-ffuf
```

## What is ffuf?
FFuf is an open source (MIT license) fuzzing tool to detect content and elements on webservers and web applications.
People often use it as a web directory bruteforcer, but it is also capable of fuzzing much more than that (e.g. XSS, SQLi,...).

With this scanner the secure code box also installs SecLists wordlists.

## Scanner Configuration
The mandatory parameters are `-u` and either `-w` or `--input-cmd` (normally `-w` is used):
- `-u`: The url to scan (e.g. https://securecodebox.io/FUZZ), which may also contain the FUZZ keyword.
- `-w`: The path to the wordlist.txt file. How to get your wordlist into the scanner? -> See below at section [Wordlist Configmap](#wordlist-configmap).

To define the test case for ffuf, use the keyword FUZZ anywhere in the URL (-u), headers (-H), or POST data (-d).

Full argument description from ffuf:
