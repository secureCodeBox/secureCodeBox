## Additional Chart Configurations

### Rule Configuration
The _rules_ can be defined in the `values` of the HelmChart.
The syntax and semantic for these rules are quite similar to CascadingRules (See: [secureCodeBox | CascadingRules](/docs/api/crds/cascading-rule))

To define rules you will have to provide the `rules` field with one or more `matches` elements.
Each `machtes` defines one Rule.
For example:

```yaml
rules:
  - matches:
      anyOf:
        - category: "Open Port"
          attributes:
            port: 23
            state: open
    override:
      severity: "high"
      description: "Telnet is bad"
```

This rule will match all findings with an open port on 23 and override the severity for this finding with `high` as well as providing a new description `Telnet is bad!`.

#### matches

Within the `matches` you will have to provide `anyOf` and `override`.
In the `anyOff` contains one or more conditions to be met by the finding to match the rule.
Notice that only one of these elements needs to match the finding for the rule to match.

#### override

The `override` field specifies the desired fields and values that need to be updated or added if the rule is matching.
