## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on Kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## What is "Finding Post Processing" Hook about?
Installing the _Finding Post Processing_ hook will add a ReadAndWrite Hook to your namespace,
which can be used to add or update fields from your findings meeting specified conditions.

## Deployment
The finding-post-processing chart can be deployed via helm:

```bash
# Install HelmChart (use -n to configure another namespace)
helm upgrade --install finding-post-processing secureCodeBox/finding-post-processing
```

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=v1.11.0-0`

## Additional Chart Configurations

### Rule Configuration
The _rules_ can be defined in the `values` of the HelmChart.
The syntax and semantic for these rules are quite similar to CascadingRules (See: [secureCodeBox | CascadingRules](/docs/api/crds/cascading-rule))

To define rules you will have to provide the `rules` field with one or more `matches` elements.
Each `machtes` defines one Rule.
For example:

```yaml
rules:
  - matches:
      anyOf:
        - category: "Open Port"
          attributes:
            port: 23
            state: open
    override:
      severity: "high"
      description: "Telnet is bad"
```

This rule will match all findings with an open port on 23 and override the severity for this finding with `high` as well as providing a new description `Telnet is bad!`.

#### matches

Within the `matches` you will have to provide `anyOf` and `override`.
In the `anyOf` contains one or more conditions to be met by the finding to match the rule.
Notice that only one of these elements needs to match the finding for the rule to match.

#### override

The `override` field specifies the desired fields and values that need to be updated or added if the rule is matching.

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| hook.affinity | object | `{}` | Optional affinity settings that control how the hook job is scheduled (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/) |
| hook.image.repository | string | `"docker.io/securecodebox/hook-finding-post-processing"` | Hook image repository |
| hook.image.tag | string | defaults to the charts version | The image Tag defaults to the charts version if not defined. |
| hook.labels | object | `{}` | Add Kubernetes Labels to the hook definition |
| hook.priority | int | `0` | Hook priority. Higher priority Hooks are guaranteed to execute before low priority Hooks. |
| hook.resources | object | { requests: { cpu: "200m", memory: "100Mi" }, limits: { cpu: "400m", memory: "200Mi" } } | Optional resources lets you control resource limits and requests for the hook container. See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/ |
| hook.tolerations | list | `[]` | Optional tolerations settings that control how the hook job is scheduled (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) |
| hook.ttlSecondsAfterFinished | string | `nil` | Seconds after which the kubernetes job for the hook will be deleted. Requires the Kubernetes TTLAfterFinished controller: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/ttlafterfinished/ |
| imagePullSecrets | list | `[]` | Define imagePullSecrets when a private registry is used (see: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) |
| rules | list | `[]` |  |
