## What is OWASP secureCodeBox?

<p align="center">
  <img alt="secureCodeBox Logo" src="https://www.securecodebox.io/img/Logo_Color.svg" width="250px"/>
</p>

_[OWASP secureCodeBox][scb-github]_ is an automated and scalable open source solution that can be used to integrate various *security vulnerability scanners* with a simple and lightweight interface. The _secureCodeBox_ mission is to support *DevSecOps* Teams to make it easy to automate security vulnerability testing in different scenarios.

With the _secureCodeBox_ we provide a toolchain for continuous scanning of applications to find the low-hanging fruit issues early in the development process and free the resources of the penetration tester to concentrate on the major security issues.

The secureCodeBox project is running on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). To install it you need [Helm](https://helm.sh), a package manager for Kubernetes. It is also possible to start the different integrated security vulnerability scanners based on a docker infrastructure.

### Quickstart with secureCodeBox on Kubernetes

You can find resources to help you get started on our [documentation website](https://www.securecodebox.io) including instruction on how to [install the secureCodeBox project](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation) and guides to help you [run your first scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) with it.

## Supported Tags
- `latest`  (represents the latest stable release build)
- tagged releases, e.g. `3.0.0`, `2.9.0`, `2.8.0`, `2.7.0`

## How to use this image
This `hook` image is intended to work in combination with other `parser` images to read or manipulate `findings` results. For more information details please take a look at the [project page][scb-docs] or [documentation page][https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/defectdojo].

```bash
docker pull securecodebox/hook-persistence-defectdojo
```

## What is "Persistence DefectDojo" Hook about?
The DefectDojo hook imports the reports from scans automatically into [OWASP DefectDojo](https://www.defectdojo.org/).
The hook uses the import scan [API v2 from DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-v2-docs.html) to import the scan results.

Scan types which are both supported by the _secureCodeBox_ and DefectDojo benefit from the full feature set of DefectDojo,
like deduplication. These scan types are (see up-to-date list in [Java source][dd-scan-types-src]):

- Nmap
- Nikto
- ZAP (Baseline, API Scan and Full Scan)
- ZAP Advanced
- SSLyze
- Trivy
- Gitleaks
- Semgrep

After uploading the results to DefectDojo, it will use the findings parsed by _DefectDojo_ to overwrite the original _secureCodeBox_ findings identified by the parser. This lets you access the finding metadata like the false positive and duplicate status from _DefectDojo_ in further ReadOnly hooks, e.g. send out Slack notification for non-duplicate & non-false positive findings only.

:::warning
This hook reads only from _raw findings_ and **not** from _secureCodeBox findings_. Because _DefectDojo_ does a way better job on parsing the findings itself, instead of parsing our _secureCodeBox finding_ format with the _generic scan type_. If you want to modify a finding before it is imported into _DefectDojo_ you can write a custom [post-processing hook](/docs/how-tos/hooks) which operates on the _raw findings_.
:::

For scan types which are not supported by _DefectDojo_, the generic importer is used, which will result in a less sophisticated display of the results and fewer features inside _DefectDojo_. In the worst case, it can lead to some findings being lost - see the note below.

:::caution
Be careful when using the _DefectDojo Hook_ in combination with other _ReadAndWrite Hooks_. By default, the _secureCodeBox_ makes no guarantees about the execution order of multiple ReadAndWrite hooks, they can be executed in any order. This can lead to "lost update" problems as the _DefectDojo_ hook will overwrite all findings, which disregards the results of previously run ReadAndWrite hooks. ReadOnly hooks work fine with the _DefectDojo_ hook as they are always executed after ReadAndWrite Hooks. If you want to control the order of execution of the different hooks, take a look at the [hook priority documentation](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/hooks#hook-order) (supported with secureCodeBox 3.4.0 and later).
:::

:::caution
The _DefectDojo_ hook will send all scan results to _DefectDojo_, including those for which _DefectDojo_ does not have native support. In this case, _DefectDojo_ may incorrectly deduplicate findings, which can in some cases [lead to incomplete imports and even data loss](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/issues/5312). You can set the hook to read-only mode, which will prevent it from writing the results back to _secureCodeBox_ (`--set defectdojo.syncFindingsBack=false` during installation of the hook) if you want to rule out any data loss inside _secureCodeBox_, but this will not prevent the incorrect deduplication from affecting the data you see inside _DefectDojo_ (for this, you will need to [contribute a parser to DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/contributing/how-to-write-a-parser/)). You can also selectively disable the _DefectDojo_ hook for certain scans using the [hook selector feature](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/hooks#hook-selector) (supported with _secureCodeBox_ 3.4.0 and later).
