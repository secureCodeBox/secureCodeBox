## What is "Persistence DefectDojo" Hook about?
The DefectDojo hook imports the reports from scans automatically into [OWASP DefectDojo](https://www.defectdojo.org/).
The hook uses the import scan [API v2 from DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-v2-docs.html) to import the scan results.

This means that only scan types are supported by the hook which are both supported by the secureCodeBox and DefectDojo.
These are:

- Nmap
- Nikto
- ZAP (Baseline, API Scan and Full Scan)
- ZAP Advanced
- SSLyze
- Trivy
- Gitleaks

After uploading the results to DefectDojo, it will use the findings parsed by DefectDojo to overwrite the
original secureCodeBox findings identified by the parser. This lets you access the finding metadata like the false
positive and duplicate status from DefectDojo in further ReadOnly hooks, e.g. send out Slack notification
for non-duplicate & non-false positive findings only.

:::caution

Be careful when using the DefectDojo Hook in combination with other ReadAndWrite hooks. The secureCodeBox currently has
no way to guarantee that one ReadAndWrite hook gets executed before another ReadAndWrite hook. This can lead to
"lost update" problems as the DefectDojo hook will overwrite all findings, which disregards the results of previously
run ReadAndWrite hooks.
ReadOnly hooks work fine with the DefectDojo hook as they are always executed after ReadAndWrite Hooks.

## Additional Chart Configurations

Installing the DefectDojo persistenceProvider hook will add a _ReadOnly Hook_ to your namespace.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic defectdojo-credentials --from-literal="username=admin" --from-literal="apikey=08b7..."

helm upgrade --install dd secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo \
    --set="defectdojo.url=https://defectdojo-django.default.svc"
```

The hook will automatically import the scan results into an engagement in DefectDojo.
If the engagement doesn't exist the hook will create the engagement (CI/CD engagement) and all objects required for it
(product & product type).

You don't need any configuration for that to work, the hook will infer engagement & product names from the scan name.
If you want more control over the names or add additional meta information like the version of the tested software you
can add these via annotation to the scan. See examples below.

### Simple Example Scans

This will import the results daily into an engagements called: "zap-juiceshop-$UNIX_TIMESTAMP" (Name of the Scan created daily by the ScheduledScan), in a Product called: "zap-juiceshop" in the default DefectDojo product type.

```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: ScheduledScan
metadata:
  name: "zap-juiceshop"
spec:
  interval: 24h
  scanSpec:
    scanType: "zap-full-scan"
    parameters:
      - "-t"
      - "http://juice-shop.demo-apps.svc:3000"
```

### Complete Example Scan

This will import the results into engagement, product and product type following the labels.
The engagement will be reused by the hook for the daily scans / imports until the engagement version is increased.

```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: ScheduledScan
metadata:
  name: "zap-full-scan-juiceshop"
  annotations:
    defectdojo.securecodebox.io/product-type-name: "OWASP"
    defectdojo.securecodebox.io/product-name: "Juice Shop"
