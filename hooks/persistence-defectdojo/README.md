## What is "Persistence DefectDojo" Hook about?
The DefectDojo hook imports the reports from scans automatically into [OWASP DefectDojo](https://www.defectdojo.org/).
The hook uses the import scan [API v2 from DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-v2-docs.html) to import the scan results.

Scan types which are both supported by the secureCodeBox and DefectDojo benefit from the full feature set of DefectDojo,
like deduplication. These scan types are:

- Nmap
- Nikto
- ZAP (Baseline, API Scan and Full Scan)
- ZAP Advanced
- SSLyze
- Trivy
- Gitleaks
- Semgrep

After uploading the results to DefectDojo, it will use the findings parsed by DefectDojo to overwrite the
original secureCodeBox findings identified by the parser. This lets you access the finding metadata like the false
positive and duplicate status from DefectDojo in further ReadOnly hooks, e.g. send out Slack notification
for non-duplicate & non-false positive findings only.

For scan types which are not supported by DefectDojo, the generic importer is used, which will result in a less
sophisticated display of the results and fewer features inside DefectDojo. In the worst case, it can lead to some
findings being lost - see the note below.

:::note
A big amount of findings may require higher resource limits. Changing them may be required to avoid OOM errors.
The default values are:
```yaml
requests: {
   cpu: "200m",
   memory: "100Mi"
},
limits: {
  cpu: "400m",
   memory: "200Mi"
}
```

For example, to set the memory limit to 512Mi, we run the following command:

```bash
helm upgrade --namespace NAMESPACE --install persistence-defectdojo secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo --set="hook.resources.limits.memory=512Mi"
```
:::

:::caution

Be careful when using the DefectDojo Hook in combination with other ReadAndWrite hooks. By default, the secureCodeBox
makes no guarantees about the execution order of multiple ReadAndWrite hooks, they can be executed in any order.
This can lead to "lost update" problems as the DefectDojo hook will overwrite all findings, which disregards the
results of previously run ReadAndWrite hooks. ReadOnly hooks work fine with the DefectDojo hook as they are always
executed after ReadAndWrite Hooks. If you want to control the order of execution of the different hooks, take a look
at the [hook priority documentation](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/hooks#hook-order) (supported with
secureCodeBox 3.4.0 and later).
:::

:::caution

The DefectDojo hook will send all scan results to DefectDojo, including those for which DefectDojo does not
have native support. In this case, DefectDojo may incorrectly deduplicate findings, which can in some cases
[lead to incomplete imports and even data loss](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/issues/5312).
You can set the hook to read-only mode, which will prevent it from writing the results back to secureCodeBox
(`--set defectdojo.syncFindingsBack=false` during installation of the hook) if you want to rule out any data
loss inside secureCodeBox, but this will not prevent the incorrect deduplication from affecting the data you
see inside DefectDojo (for this, you will need to [contribute a parser to DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/contributing/how-to-write-a-parser/)).
You can also selectively disable the DefectDojo hook for certain scans using the [hook selector feature](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/hooks#hook-selector)
(supported with secureCodeBox 3.4.0 and later).
:::

### Running "Persistence DefectDojo" Hook Locally from Source
For development purposes, it can be useful to run this hook locally. You can do so by following these steps:

1. Make sure you have access to a running [DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) instance.
2. [Run a Scan](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/first-scans) of your choice.
3. Supply Download Links for the Scan Results (Raw Result and Findings.json). You can access them from the
included [Minio Instance](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation/#accessing-the-included-minio-instance)
and upload them to a GitHub Gist.
4. Set the following environment variables:

- DEFECTDOJO_URL (e.g http://192.168.0.1:8080);
- DEFECTDOJO_USERNAME (e.g admin)
- DEFECTDOJO_APIKEY= (e.g. b09c.., can be fetched from the DefectDojo API information page)
- IS_DEV=true
- SCAN_NAME (e.g nmap-scanme.nmap.org, must be set exactly to the name of the scan used in step 2)

5. Build the jar with gradle and run it with the following CLI arguments: {Raw Result Download URL} {Findings Download URL} {Raw Result Upload URL} {Findings Upload URL}.
See the code snippet below. You have to adjust the filename of the jar for other versions than the '0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'.
Also you will need to change the download URLs for the Raw Result and Findings to the ones from Step 3.

```bash
./gradlew build
java -jar build/libs/defectdojo-persistenceprovider-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../scanme-nmap-org.xml https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../nmap-findings.json https://httpbin.org/put https://httpbin.org/put
```

## Deployment
The persistence-defectdojo chart can be deployed via helm:

```bash
# Install HelmChart (use -n to configure another namespace)
helm upgrade --install persistence-defectdojo secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo
```

## Requirements

Kubernetes: `>=v1.11.0-0`

## Additional Chart Configurations

Installing the DefectDojo persistenceProvider hook will add a _ReadAndWrite Hook_ to your namespace.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic defectdojo-credentials --from-literal="username=admin" --from-literal="apikey=08b7..."

helm upgrade --install dd secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo \
    --set="defectdojo.url=https://defectdojo-django.default.svc"
```

The hook will automatically import the scan results into an engagement in DefectDojo.
If the engagement doesn't exist the hook will create the engagement (CI/CD engagement) and all objects required for it
(product & product type). The hook will then pull the imported information from DefectDojo and use them to replace the
findings inside secureCodeBox.

In case you use a DefectDojo instance with a self-signed root CA, upgrade the hook with:
```bash
helm upgrade --install dd secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo \
    --set="defectdojo.url=https://defectdojo-django.default.svc" \
    --set-json 'hook.extraVolumes=[{"name": "ca-dojo", "configMap": {"name": "ca-dojo"}}]' \
    --set-json 'hook.extraVolumeMounts=[{"name": "ca-dojo", "mountPath": "/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts", "subPath": "cacerts", "readOnly": false}]'
```
After, you can update `/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts` with your certificate.

You don't need any configuration for that to work, the hook will infer engagement & product names from the scan name.
If you want more control over the names or add additional meta information like the version of the tested software you
can add these via annotation to the scan. See examples below.

| Scan Annotation                                                    | Description                | Default if not set                                                   | Notes                                                                                 |

### Read-only Mode

By default, the DefectDojo hook will pull the imported results from DefectDojo and use them to replace the results inside secureCodeBox.
This allows you to benefit from DefectDojo's deduplication logic and only trigger follow-up scans or notifications for new findings.
If you want to disable this feature, you can install the hook in read-only mode using `--set defectdojo.syncFindingsBack=false` while
installing the hook using Helm.

### Notes on `syncFindingBack` Mode & Duplicate Findings

Attributes like if a finding has been marked as accepted or has been marked as a false positive in DefectDojo are only attached to the original finding. The duplicated findings will always have the `falsePositive`, `riskAccepted` and `outOfScope` attributes set to false as they have just been imported. To enable users to access this meta information on the original the `syncFindingBack` mode automatically embeds the orignal finding in the attributes of synced back duplicate findings. The following example shows a finding produced by the `syncFindingBack` mode, in which the original finding has been marked as accepted.

```yaml

### Low Privileged Mode

By default the DefectDojo Hook requires a API Token with platform wide "Staff" access rights.

DefectDojo >2.0.0 refined their user access rights, allowing you to restrict the users access rights to only view specific product types in DefectDojo.
The secureCodeBox DefectDojo Hook can be configured to run with such a token of a "low privileged" users by setting the `defectdojo.lowPrivilegedMode=true`.

#### Limitations of the Low Privileged Mode

- Instead of the username, the userId **must** be configured as the low privileged can't use the users list api to look up its own userId.
- The configured product type must exist beforehand as the low privileged user isn't permitted to create a new one
- The hook will not create / link the engagement to the secureCodeBox orchestration engine tool type.
- The low privileged user must have at least the `Maintainer` role in the configured product type.

#### Low Privileged Mode Install Example

```bash
kubectl create secret generic defectdojo-credentials --from-literal="apikey=08b7..."

helm upgrade --install dd secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo \
    --set="defectdojo.url=http://defectdojo-django.default.svc" \
    --set="defectdojo.lowPrivilegedMode=true" \
    --set="defectdojo.authentication.userId=42"
```

### DefectDojo minimum severity

It has come to our attention, that DefectDojo become slow when handling a lot of data. A lot of data in DefectDojo can be informational findings one likes to ignore.
Therefore Defectdojo provides the option to only create findings for scan finding from a certain severity level and above, thus lowering the amount of data stored.
We integrate this option in our scans by providing the "defectdojo.securecodebox.io/minimum_severity" annotation for scans.
This is an example of how the minimum severity for findings of a scan can be set:
```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: ScheduledScan
metadata:
  name: "zap-juiceshop"
  annotations:
      defectdojo.securecodebox.io/minimum_severity: "Low"
spec:
  interval: 24h
  scanSpec:
    scanType: "zap-full-scan"
    parameters:
      - "-t"
      - "http://juice-shop.demo-targets.svc:3000"
```
In this example only for scan findings with a severity of "Low" or higher there are findings in DefectDojo created.

### Simple Example Scans

This will run a daily scan using ZAP on a demo target. The results will be imported using the name "zap-juiceshop-$UNIX_TIMESTAMP" (Name of the Scan created by the ScheduledScan), in a product called "zap-juiceshop" in the default DefectDojo product type.

```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: ScheduledScan
metadata:
  name: "zap-juiceshop"
spec:
  interval: 24h
  scanSpec:
    scanType: "zap-full-scan"
    parameters:
      - "-t"
      - "http://juice-shop.demo-targets.svc:3000"
```

### Complete Example Scan

This will import the results into engagement, product and product type following the labels.
The engagement will be reused by the hook for the daily scans / imports until the engagement version is increased.

```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: ScheduledScan
metadata:
  name: "zap-full-scan-juiceshop"
  annotations:
    defectdojo.securecodebox.io/product-type-name: "OWASP"
