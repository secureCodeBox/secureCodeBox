Declarative Subsequent Scan Hook deployed.

This will allow you to start Scans based on previous findings.
E.g. start a ssh scan for every open ssh port found.

The rules are defined as kubernetes CRD's. You can list all of these `CascadingScanRules` by running:

$ kubectl get cascadingrules

You need to explicitly turn on scan cascading for every scan you use.
You can do that by setting a label selector which matches all rules you want to use.
