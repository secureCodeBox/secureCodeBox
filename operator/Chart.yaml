        The Scan Custom Resource Definition (CRD) lets you define how a specific security scan should be configured.

        The ScheduledScan Custom Resource Definition (CRD) lets you define a Scan which gets repeated in a specific time interval, 
        e.g. every 24 hours or every 7 days. More details about this CRD are documented here: https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/scheduled-scan

      description:  |
        CascadingRules are Custom Resource Definitions (CRD's) used to define how scans can be started automatically based on the results of previous scans. 
        This lets you run large exploratory scans and automatically start more in depth scans on the targets found by the initial scans.

      displayName: secureCodeBox ScanType
      description:  |
        The ScanType Custom Resource Definition (CRD) is used to define to the secureCodeBox how a specific scanner can be executed in Kubernetes. 
        The main part of the ScanType is the JobTemplate, which contains a Kubernetes Job definition which will be used to construct the scans Job.

        ParseDefinitions are Custom Resource Definitions (CRD's) used to describe to the secureCodeBox 
        how it can convert a raw finding report (e.g. XML report from nmap) into the generic secureCodeBox finding format.
