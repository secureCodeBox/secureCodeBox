**TL;DR** We remove the Vagrant All-in-One Setup completely.

<!--truncate-->

Since the introduction of Apple Silicon CPUs we couldn't run [Vagrant][vagrant] with [Virtualbox][virtualbox] anymore because Virtualbox is not ported on ARM at the moment. This may change in the future. I've also tried to get Vagrant up and running with other hypervisors (e.g. VMWare, QEMU), but didn't worked out well ðŸ˜«

Since the setup of _secureCodeBox_ with [Minikube][minikube], [Kind][kind] or [Colima][colima] is quite easy we drop Vagrant completely. With Colima, you can also run x86 images easily on arm hist as described in [Run x86 Images With Kubernetes on Apple Silicon][colima-setup].

To be honest, using VMs is so 20th century like ðŸ˜¬
