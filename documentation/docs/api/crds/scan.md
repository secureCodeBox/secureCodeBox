The Scan Custom Resource Definition (CRD) lets you define how a specific scan should be configured.
The secureCodeBox Operator uses this specification to execute the scan.

## Specification (Spec)

### ScanType (Required)

The `scanType` references the **name** of a [ScanType Custom Resource](/docs/api/crds/scan-type/).

### Parameters (Required)

`parameters` is a string array of command line flags that are passed to the scanner.

These typically contain scanner-specific configurations and target specifications.

### Env (Optional)

`env` lets you pass custom environment variables to the scan container.
This can be useful for passing secret values like login credentials that scanners require without defining them in plain text.

The `env` field has the same API as the "env" property on Kubernetes Pods.

See:

- [Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/)
- [API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#environment-variables)

### Volumes (Optional)

`volumes` lets you specify Kubernetes volumes to make available to the scan container.
Similar to `env`, it can be used to pass data into a container.
It must be combined with [`volumeMounts`](#volumemounts-optional) to be useful (see below).
It can also be used in combination with `initContainers` to provision files, VCS repositories, or other content into a scanner - see [`initContainers`](#initcontainers-optional) for an example.

`volumes` has the same API as the `volumes` property on Kubernetes pods.

See:

- [Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/)
- [API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#volumes-1)

### VolumeMounts (Optional)

`volumeMounts` lets you specify where previously-created volumes should be mounted inside the container.
It is used in combination with [`volumes`](#volumes-optional) (see above).

`volumeMounts` has the same API as the `volumeMounts` property on Kubernetes pods.

See:

- [Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-volume-storage/)
- [API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#volumes-1)

### InitContainers (Optional)

`initContainers` lets you specify one or more containers that run before the scan itself.
You can specify arbitrary containers with any commands you need.
By default, init containers do not share a filesystem with the scan job.
To use init containers for provisioning files or directories for the scan job, you must explicitly create a volume and mount it to both the init container and the scan job using [`volumeMounts`](#volumemounts-optional).
For example, if you want to download a file that contains a list of scan targets for nmap, you could configure the scan like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "nmap-from-web"
spec:
  # Specify a volume that will be used to share files between the containers
  volumes:
    - name: target-list
      emptyDir: {}
  # Mount the volume to the scanner at the path /targets
  volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: "/targets/"
      name: target-list
  # Declare the initContainers
  initContainers:
    # For this, we use only a single init container - you can specify multiple, and they will be executed sequentially
    - name: "download-targets"
      # Use the "busybox" image, which contains wget
      image: busybox
      # Launch wget to download a list of targets and place it in /targets/targets.txt
      command:
        - wget
        - "https://my.website.tld/targets.txt"
        - "-O"
        - /targets/targets.txt
      # Make the volume used above available to the initContainer as well, at the same path
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/targets/"
          name: target-list
  # Declare the actual scan you want to perform, using the downloaded file
  scanType: "nmap"
  parameters:
    - "-iL"
    - "/targets/targets.txt"
```

`initContainers` has the same API as the `initContainers` property on Kubernetes pods, which is a list of `container`s.

See:

- [Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/)
- [API Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#containers)

### ResourceMode (Optional)

The `resourceMode` specifies whether the scan should use namespace-local or cluster-wide resources (ScanType vs. ClusterScanType). Valid values are:

- `"namespaceLocal"` (default): Uses ScanType resources from the same namespace
- `"clusterWide"`: Uses ClusterScanType resources available cluster-wide

### NodeSelector (Optional)

[`nodeSelector`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/) allows you to specify a simple node selection constraint to control which nodes the scan can be scheduled on.

```yaml
nodeSelector:
  kubernetes.io/arch: amd64
  node-type: scanner
```

### Affinity and Tolerations (Optional)

[`affinity`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes-using-node-affinity/) and [`tolerations`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) can be used to control which nodes the scan is executed on with more advanced rules than nodeSelector.

### Cascades (Optional)

`cascades` let you start new scans based on the results of the current scan.

The cascades config in the scans spec contains [Kubernetes Label Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/label-selector/) which allow you to select which [CascadingRule](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/cascading-rule) are allowed to be used by the cascading logic.

Furthermore, in the cascade config you can specify whether cascading scans should inherit fields from the parent scan:

- `inheritLabels`: `true`
- `inheritAnnotations`: `true`
- `inheritEnv`: `false`
- `inheritVolumes`: `false`
- `inheritInitContainers`: `false`
- `inheritHookSelector`: `false`
- `inheritAffinity`: `true`
- `inheritTolerations`: `true`

These fields will merge the parent's entries with entries defined in the cascading rules.
Entries defined in cascading rules apply only to the current scan.
There are two exceptions: for Affinity and Tolerations, entries are replaced rather than merged and apply to all subsequent scans.

:::caution
Defining identical entries in both the Scan AND the Cascading Rule resource will lead to undefined behaviour.
See [#789](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/issues/789) for more details.
:::

To use cascades you'll need to have the [CascadingScan hook](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/cascading-scans) installed.
For an example on how they can be used see the [Scanning Networks HowTo](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/scanning-networks)

#### ScopeLimiter (Optional)

`scopeLimiter` allows you to define rules that cascading scans must comply with before they may cascade.
For example, you can define that follow-up scans against a host are only allowed if its IP address is within a predefined IP range.
You can use Mustache templating to select specific properties from findings.

Under `scopeLimiter`, you may specify `anyOf`, `noneOf`, and `allOf` with a selector to limit your scope.
If you specify multiple fields, all the rules must pass.

A selector looks similar to the [Kubernetes Label Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/label-selector/).

```yaml
anyOf:
  - key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/cidr"
    operator: "InCIDR"
    values: ["{{attributes.ip}}"]
```

The `key` references one of the annotations defined on your scan.
The annotation name _must_ start with `scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/`.
These annotations can only be added on the initial scan (i.e., they cannot be modified using the [`scanAnnotations`](/docs/api/crds/cascading-rule#scanlabels--scanannotations-optional) field of the cascading scan rules) and are inherited by default.

`operator` is one of `In`, `NotIn`, `Contains`, `DoesNotContain`, `InCIDR`, `NotInCIDR`, `SubdomainOf`, `NotSubdomainOf`.

`values` is a list of values for which the selector should pass.

The `validOnMissingRender` field in scopeLimiter defines whether a condition should match when a templating variable is not present in the finding. Defaults to `false`.

##### Selecting lists

A custom rendering function has been provided to select attributes in findings that are in a list. An example finding:

```json title="Finding"
{
  "name": "Subdomains found",
  "category": "Subdomain",
  "attributes": {
    "domains": ["example.com", "subdomain.example.com"]
  }
}
```

To select the domains data in this finding, use the `asList` notation as shown below.

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain: "example.com"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain"
operator: "In"
values: ["{{#asList}}{{attributes.domains}}{{/asList}}"]
```

The values will render to: `["example.com", "subdomain.example.com"]`.

Some findings have data in lists of objects, such as the following:

```json title="Finding"
{
  "name": "Subdomains found",
  "category": "Subdomain",
  "attributes": {
    "addresses": [
      {
        "domain": "example.com",
        "ip": "127.0.0.1"
      },
      {
        "domain": "subdomain.example.com",
        "ip": "127.0.0.2"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To select the domains data in this finding, use the `getValues` notation as shown below.

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain: "example.com"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain"
operator: "In"
# Note that the parameter is *not* set inside curly braces!
values: ["{{#getValues}}attributes.addresses.domain{{/getValues}}"]
```

You can also manually split values from findings if your finding is like so:

```json title="Finding"
{
  "name": "Subdomains found",
  "category": "Subdomain",
  "attributes": {
    "domains": "example.com,subdomain.example.com"
  }
}
```

To select the domains data in this finding, use the `split` notation as shown below.

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain: "example.com"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain"
operator: "In"
values: ["{{#split}}{{attributes.domains}}{{/split}}"]
```

##### Operators

`In` & `NotIn`: The scope annotation value exists in one of `values`. Matching example:

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain: "example.com"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain"
operator: "In"
values: ["example.com", "subdomain.example.com"]
```

`Contains` & `DoesNotContain`: The scope annotation value is considered a comma-seperated list and checks if every `values` is in that list. Matching example:

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain: "example.com,subdomain.example.com,other.example.com"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain"
operator: "Contains"
values: ["example.com", "subdomain.example.com"]
```

`InCIDR` & `NotInCIDR`: The scope annotation value is considered a [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) and checks if every `values` is within the subnet of that CIDR. Supports both IPv4 and IPv6. If the scope is defined in IPv4, will only validate IPv4 IPs in the finding values. Vice-versa for IPv6 defined in scope and IPv4 found in values. Note that all IPs in finding values must be valid addresses, regardless of whether IPv4 or IPv6 was used in the scope definition. Matching example:

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/cidr: "10.10.0.0/16"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/cidr"
operator: "InCIDR"
values: ["10.10.1.2", "10.10.1.3", "2001:0:ce49:7601:e866:efff:62c3:fffe"]
```

`SubdomainOf` & `NotSubdomainOf`: Checks if every `values` is a subdomain of the scope annotation value (inclusive; i.e. example.com is a subdomain of example.com). Matching example:

```yaml
annotations:
  scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain: "example.com"
---
key: "scope.cascading.securecodebox.io/domain"
operator: "SubdomainOf"
values: ["subdomain.example.com", "example.com"]
```

See the [Scope HowTo](/docs/how-tos/scope) for more information.

### HookSelector (Optional)

`hookSelector` allows you to select which hooks to run using [Kubernetes Label Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/common-definitions/label-selector/).

You can only select hooks within the namespace where the scan is running.

Leaving this field undefined selects all available hooks in the namespace.

```yaml
hookSelector:
  matchExpressions:
    - key: app.kubernetes.io/instance
      operator: In
      values: ["defectdojo", "cascading-scans"]
```

:::note
Cascading scans are currently implemented as a hook.
To use cascading scans in combination with hookSelector, ensure that you also select the cascading scans hook.
The cascading scan hook, as well as any future core secureCodeBox features implemented as hooks, carry the label `securecodebox.io/internal: true` to make this easier.
:::

For more examples on how this field can be used, see the [Hook HowTo](/docs/how-tos/hooks).

### Resources (Optional)

`resources` lets you override the resource limits and requests for the primary scanner container from the values defined in the [ScanType](./scan-type). See https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 42mi
    memory: 256Mi
  limits:
    cpu: 4
    memory: 4Gi
```

### TTLSecondsAfterFinished
`ttlSecondsAfterFinished` deletes the scan after a specified duration.

```yaml
ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 30 #deletes the scan after 30 seconds after completion
```

:::note
ttlSecondsAfterFinished can also be set for the scan (as part of the [jobTemplate](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/scan-type#jobtemplate-required)), [parser](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/parse-definition) and [hook](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/scan-completion-hook#ttlsecondsafterfinished-optional) jobs individually. Setting these will only delete the jobs, not the entire scan.
