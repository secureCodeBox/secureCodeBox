---

Under the topic "project management" we describe how we do the organizational stuff besides coding such as on-/off-boarding new maintainers or contributors.

## Infrastructure

- We use GitHub for source code and issue management.
  - We have an own organization named [secureCodeBox](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/).
  - Management of issues is done with a belonging [project](https://github.com/orgs/secureCodeBox/projects/6).
- We will use the OWASP Google Workspace.
  - **TODO** We need to find out hwo to get access.

## Teams

In our GitHub organization we have several teams:

1. _admin-team_: members are the _project leads_. 
2. _core-team_: Company sponsored core team.
3. _contributor-team_: Active contributors from the community.
4. _bot-team_: Team containing all bots allowed to push directly to the main branch.

## On- and Off-Boarding

**TODO** Describe on-/off-boarding
