title: "Project Management"
---

Under the topic "project management" we describe how we do the organizational stuff besides coding such as on-/off-boarding new maintainers or contributors.

## Infrastructure

- We use GitHub for source code and issue management:
  - We have an own organization named [secureCodeBox](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/).
  - Management of issues is done with a belonging [project](https://github.com/orgs/secureCodeBox/projects/6).
- We use the OWASP Google Workspace:
  - A [shared drive][google-shared-drive] to store meeting notes.
  - And a project calendar:
    - [internal link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y19mODdhNThiMGNmZjNmMWMwMTk5ZjlhNDc1MjVjMmNiMGU3NjkwZmRjMTliZTI2NDlmMGU5YjlmMDA1ZTc3Mjc4QGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20)

## Teams

In our GitHub organization we have several teams:

1. _admin-team_: members are the _project leads_. 
2. _core-team_: Company sponsored core team.
3. _contributor-team_: Active contributors from the community.
4. _bot-team_: Team containing all bots allowed to push directly to the main branch.

## Organizational

- The _project leads_ do a regular sync meeting:
  - Monday 16:05-17:00 CET, every 4 weeks from 28.5.25 on. Next meetings: 23.6.25, 21.7.25 etc.
  - We write an agenda beforehand and notes in a Google Doc, one per meeting.
  - There is a template document in the shared drive.

## On- and Off-Boarding

**TODO** Describe on-/off-boarding
