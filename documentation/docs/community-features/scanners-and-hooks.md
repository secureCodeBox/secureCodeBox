:::note
Thanks to our community, there are even more features available for the *secureCodeBox* than in the main branch
and official releases. This site gives an overview about all community features that are currently known to us.
If you want your feature to get listed here or to have it removed, please 
[contact us](mailto:securecodebox@iteratec.com). Features added to this list have been checked at least once by the core
development team to fit the general concept of the *secureCodeBox*. However, we cannot guarantee that they are 
compatible with the latest release. You have to use them on your own responsibility and risk.
