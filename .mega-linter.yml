# Configuration file for MegaLinter
# See all available variables at https://megalinter.github.io/configuration/ and in linters documentation

APPLY_FIXES: none # all, none, or list of linter keys
# ENABLE: # If you use ENABLE variable, all other languages/formats/tooling-formats will be disabled by default
# ENABLE_LINTERS: # If you use ENABLE_LINTERS variable, all other linters will be disabled by default
DISABLE:
  - COPYPASTE # Comment to enable checks of excessive copy-pastes
  - MARKDOWN # Disable markdown as the readmes are generated automatically
  - CREDENTIALS # Disable checks for credentials, as there are some false positives in the repo for documentation purposes (e.g demo-targets)
DISABLE_LINTERS:
  - JAVASCRIPT_STANDARD # standard is a javascript linter that by design can not be configured in any way. This project uses eslint anyways.
  - SPELL_CSPELL # disable cspell because if finds way to many false positives and it would be way to much work to exclude all false positives
  - EDITORCONFIG_EDITORCONFIG # this linter complains about non important stuff like tabs instead of spaces etc. Disabled because its annoying
  - PYTHON_MYPY # fails because missing cache file "error: --install-types failed (no mypy cache directory)". See https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/10600#issuecomment-857351152
