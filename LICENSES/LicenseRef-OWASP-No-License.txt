3. USAGE REQUIREMENTS

These Usage Guidelines address only the most common uses of the OWASP Word Mark and OWASP Logo. Merely because a particular use of one of the marks is not described in these Usage Guidelines does not mean it is either allowed or prohibited. It is important to note that the rules sometimes vary from country to country and from case to case. For questions regarding any use of the OWASP Word Mark or OWASP Logo that is not described in these Usage Guidelines, contact [insert the best email and/or phone number].

3.1 USAGE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO BOTH THE OWASP WORD MARK AND OWASP LOGO

Licensee shall comply with the following form requirements regarding the use of the OWASP Word Mark and/or OWASP Logo:

a. NO MISREPRESENTATION AS TO MEANING: The OWASP Word Mark and/or OWASP Logo must never be used in any manner that is likely to suggest or imply OWASP Foundation’s endorsement of a specific company or its products, services, training materials, and/or events. You may not use the OWASP Word Mark or OWASP Logo in any way that could cause confusion as to source or as to ownership of the OWASP Word Mark or OWASP Logo or in any way that could damage the goodwill in the marks.

b. DO NOT DISPARAGE: The OWASP Word Mark and OWASP Logo must not be used in any manner or on any material that disparages or is likely to disparage OWASP Foundation, the OWASP Top Ten, or OWASP Foundation’s other services or materials, or in any other manner that is, or is likely to be, misleading, obscene, infringing, or that dilutes, impairs, or diminishes (or is likely to dilute, impair, or diminish) OWASP Foundation’s rights and goodwill in the OWASP Word Mark and/or OWASP Logo. The OWASP Word Mark and/or OWASP Logo must not be used in connection with any unlawful activities or to encourage unlawful activities. Licensee shall display the OWASP Word Mark and OWASP Logo only in a positive manner.

c. NOTICE SYMBOLS: The OWASP Word Mark and the OWASP Logo should appear with the registered trademark symbol or unregistered trademark symbol, as applicable and discussed below. The symbol must be legible at all times. For the OWASP Logo, the symbol must be displayed exactly as shown in the OWASP Foundation digital artwork files to which Licensee is given access.

When using the OWASP Word Mark and/or OWASP Logo in countries where the OWASP Word Mark is registered, use the ® symbol next to the OWASP Word Mark and next to the “OWASP” portion of the OWASP Logo (for the logo, the ® symbol must be placed solely next to the OWASP word to avoid falsely indicating that the entire logo is registered). When using the marks anywhere else where the marks are not registered, use the ™ symbol next to the OWASP Word Mark and OWASP Logo. Currently, the OWASP Word Mark is registered in the United States. If and when one or both of the marks are registered elsewhere, OWASP Foundation will update these Usage Guidelines.

Do not use the ® symbol for the OWASP Word Mark or OWASP Logo in any country in which the applicable mark is not registered. Falsely indicating that a mark is registered may trigger civil and criminal penalties. As such, for materials that will be distributed in multiple countries, including countries where the applicable mark is registered and others where it is not, use the ™ symbol. In other words, if you cannot ensure that materials displaying the ® symbol with the OWASP Word Mark and/or “OWASP” portion of the OWASP Logo will not be distributed into countries where the mark is not registered, then you must use the ™ symbol instead.

When using the OWASP Logo, you must always include the appropriate symbol (® or ™) next to the logo for all uses; again, you must always use the artwork provided by OWASP Foundation, which will include the appropriate symbol. When using the OWASP Word Mark, the appropriate symbol (® or ™) must be included with the initial and/or most prominent use of the OWASP® Word Mark in any materials in which it appears or is used.

d. ATTRIBUTION: OWASP Foundation requires you to attribute ownership of the OWASP Word Mark and OWASP Logo to OWASP Foundation by using a trademark ownership legend in all training materials, web pages, marketing collateral, and all other materials that show the wordmark or logo. The preferred form of the legend is:

    “The OWASP® Word Mark and OWASP & Design™ Logo are registered or unregistered service marks of OWASP Foundation, Inc. in the United States and other countries. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use strictly prohibited.”

3.2 FORM REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE OWASP LOGO

Licensee shall comply with the following form requirements regarding the use of the OWASP Logo:

  https://owasp.org/www-policy/branding-assets/OWASP-Combination-mark-r.png

a. OBTAINING THE OWASP LOGO: OWASP Foundation will provide access to the graphic files depicting the OWASP Logo after Licensee and OWASP Foundation have both signed the required trademark license agreement. OWASP will provide one version of the OWASP Logo that contains an ® symbol next to the “OWASP” portion of the OWASP Logo for use in countries where the OWASP Word Mark is registered. And OWASP Foundation will provide a second version of the OWASP Logo that only shows the ™ symbol for use in countries where the mark is not registered. Licensee is only permitted to use the logo artwork files provided by OWASP Foundation.

b. DO NOT ALTER LOGO: Licensee must use the OWASP Logo exactly as it appears in the digital artwork files to which Licensee is given access by OWASP Foundation. Licensee may not use any third-party artwork files for the OWASP Logo. Do not change the proportion or position of elements within the logo, alter the logo in perspective or appearance, or otherwise alter, separate, stretch, distort, or change the colors of the logo.

c. DO NOT ADD WORDS OR DESIGNS: The OWASP Logo may not be combined with or incorporated into any other feature, including without limitation, other trademarks or service marks, words, phrases, graphics, photos, slogans, numbers, design features, or symbols.

d. LICENSEE’S BRAND: Licensee’s company name, product name, or company logo must appear on any materials where the OWASP Logo appears. The OWASP Logo must be smaller and less prominent than Licensee’s company name, product name, or company logo.

f. SIZE: The OWASP Logo must not be displayed in size so small that any design feature or the registered or unregistered trademark notice symbol of the OWASP Logo is lost.

g. SPACING: The area directly around the OWASP Logo should remain clear of all images or text. The OWASP Logo should always be surrounded by an adequate amount of clear space in order to set it apart from other elements. Do not place the OWASP Logo on a busy background.

h. NO UBIQUITOUS USES: Avoid ubiquitous uses of the OWASP Logo. For example, do not incorporate the OWASP Logo into a background to be used at a trade show booth or as a watermark or background for a PowerPoint presentation. Further, the OWASP Logo may not be used as a design feature in any Licensee company materials.

i. THIRD PARTY MARKS: The OWASP Logo should never be obstructed by any Licensee or third-party trademark or logo. In all cases, the OWASP Logo should be displayed equally and fairly compared to third-party logos and trademarks when placed on a website or other materials containing third-party logos or trademarks.

3.3 FORM REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE OWASP WORDMARK

When using the OWASP Word Mark, Licensee must comply with the following requirements:

    DO NOT ALTER: Licensee shall not alter or separate the OWASP Word Mark, and should not vary the spelling, add hyphens, make one word two words or more, use a similar mark, use a phonetic equivalent, use abbreviations, translate the mark, or otherwise alter or modify the mark in any way.
    USE AS ADJECTIVE: When using the OWASP Word Mark in text, Licensee must use the OWASP Word Mark as an adjective that is followed by a noun, i.e., a generic description of the goods or services (such as the “OWASP® Top Ten list”). Never use the mark as a verb or noun or in the possessive or plural forms.
    NO USE IN COMPANY NAMES: The OWASP Word Mark (or any variation thereof) must not be used in any company name, product name, model number, part number, service name, or domain name.
