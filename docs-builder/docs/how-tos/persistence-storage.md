title: "Storing Findings with Persistence Hooks"
description: "Ingesting identified findings to DefectDojo or Elasticsearch"
sidebar_position: 5

## Introduction 

Let's say you have to manage a cluster of potential security risks, like for example a large number of websites or
your company's internal network. Your needs will exceed the limitations of manual findings handling or our build-in
*minio* instance quite soon. The solution comes with a so-called *persistence provider*, which not only allows you
to store your findings over a long period of time (as the name suggests), but also to classify, prioritize and analyze 
them. This tutorial discusses two persistence providers, [DefectDojo](#defectdojo) and [ElasticSearch](#elasticsearch), 
which can both be combined with the *secureCodeBox*.

*Side-note: The tutorials are scanning scanme.nmap.org, which is a public service provided by nmap. It is meant
to be used for port-scanning examples, but should not be abused with too much scanning per day. If you know that
your local machine is providing meaningful findings as well, consider using *localhost* as target for all scans.
We chose to use scanme.nmap.org in the tutorial however, because of reproducibility for most users.*

### Pre-Requirements
*All setups have been tested with Ubuntu 22.04 and Kubernetes 1.24*

Make sure you have the following tools available on your system before starting:
* [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/de/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation) 
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## DefectDojo

[DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo) is a widespread platform for vulnerability management
and security orchestration. The *secureCodeBox* provides a hook that allows to directly connect the *SCB* to a local
or remote DefectDojo instance. In this tutorial, we will at first guide you through a step-by-step setup manual.
After that, you will learn about some features of DefectDojo and how you can use them in conjunction with the
*secureCodeBox*.

We will now at first set up an instance of DefectDojo in a local minikube cluster. After we have that running,
we install the *secureCodeBox* and the [DefectDojo hook](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/defectdojo/).

### DefectDojo Kubernetes setup 

(General, more detailed instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/dev/readme-docs/KUBERNETES.md))

:::info
At the moment **DefectDojo does not provide a Docker image for arm64**. As a workaround you can run a local instance
of DefectDojo (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)).
:::

Using *minikube* (for kind clusters see instructions below):
```bash
# Download DefectDojo repo
git clone https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo
cd django-DefectDojo

# Start the cluster
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress

# Get helm charts (bitnami necessary for Helm >= v3)
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm dependency update ./helm/defectdojo

# Install DefectDojo helm chart
helm upgrade --install \
  defectdojo \
  ./helm/defectdojo \
  --set django.ingress.enabled=true \
  --set django.ingress.activateTLS=false \
  --set createSecret=true \
  --set createRabbitMqSecret=true \
  --set createRedisSecret=true \
  --set createMysqlSecret=true \
  --set createPostgresqlSecret=true \
  --set host="defectdojo.default.minikube.local" \
  --set "alternativeHosts={localhost,defectdojo.default.minikube.local:8080,defectdojo-django.default.svc}"
```

<details>
<summary>Using kind:</summary>
<code>
git clone https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo
cd django-DefectDojo

kind create cluster

helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm dependency update ./helm/defectdojo

helm upgrade --install \
  defectdojo \
  ./helm/defectdojo \
  --set django.ingress.enabled=true \
  --set django.ingress.activateTLS=false \
  --set createSecret=true \
  --set createRabbitMqSecret=true \
  --set createRedisSecret=true \
  --set createMysqlSecret=true \
  --set createPostgresqlSecret=true \
  --set host="defectdojo.default.kind.local" \
  --set "alternativeHosts={localhost,defectdojo.default.kind.local:8080,defectdojo-django.default.svc}"
</code>
</details>

After a while, you should see that all pods are running:
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

To access DefectDojo locally, you probably need to add the following lines to `/etc/hosts`:
```text
# Minikube
::1       defectdojo.default.minikube.local
127.0.0.1 defectdojo.default.minikube.local
# Kind
::1       defectdojo.default.kind.local
127.0.0.1 defectdojo.default.kind.local
```

Now, retrieve the admin password:
```bash
echo "DefectDojo admin password: $(kubectl \
      get secret defectdojo \
      --namespace=default \
      --output jsonpath='{.data.DD_ADMIN_PASSWORD}' \
      | base64 --decode)"
```

After that, we can port-forward the DefectDojo service and thereby verify that the installation was successful:
```bash
kubectl port-forward --namespace=default service/defectdojo-django 8080:80
```

We are finally ready to access our DefectDojo instance! In your browser, switch to 
[defectdojo.default.minikube.local:8080](http://defectdojo.default.minikube.local:8080) or
[defectdojo.default.kind.local:8080](http://defectdojo.default.kind.local:8080). 
You should see the DefectDojo login mask. 
Enter `admin` as username and type the password that you received in the step before.
Once logged in, you need to get your *API v2 Key*. Click on the person symbol in the upper-right corner and choose
*API v2 Key*. There should be a line like `Your current API key is abcdef123456789...`. Save it for later.

### secureCodeBox setup
(General setup instructions can be found [here](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/getting-started/installation))

At first, we install the operator and a scanner:
```bash
# Install the operator
helm repo add secureCodeBox https://charts.securecodebox.io
kubectl create namespace securecodebox-system
helm --namespace securecodebox-system upgrade --install securecodebox-operator secureCodeBox/operator

# Create a namespace for scanning - makes it easier to read logs if something went wrong
kubectl create namespace scanning
# Install nmap scanner for the later tutorial steps
helm upgrade --namespace scanning --install nmap secureCodeBox/nmap
```

To install the DefectDojo hook, we need to create a secret with the API v2 Key we retrieved before:
```bash
kubectl create secret generic defectdojo-credentials -n scanning \
  --from-literal="username=admin" --from-literal="apikey=<APIv2KEY>"
```

Finally, we can install the DefectDojo hook via helm:
```bash
helm upgrade --namespace scanning --install dd secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo
```

To verify that everything works, we now start an nmap scan and check that its results are uploaded to our DefectDojo
instance. Create the following file:
```yaml
# scan.yaml
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: the secureCodeBox authors
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "nmap-scanme.nmap.org"
spec:
  scanType: "nmap"
  parameters:
    - scanme.nmap.org
```

We then apply it via:
```bash
kubectl apply -n scanning -f scan.yaml
```

If everything was set up correctly, you should see an *nmap-scanme.nmap.org* engagement in the DefectDojo engagements
dashboard after a while. Should you have experienced any problems, you might find advice in the 
[troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section at the end.

### Managing findings via the secureCodeBox and DefectDojo
To give you an idea of how a workflow with the *secureCodeBox* and DefectDojo can look like, we will take a glance at
DefectDojo's findings de-duplication ability. When scanning the same target multiple times, e.g. with a 
[scheduled scan](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/automatically-repeating-scans), we do not want to get 
notified about findings that are duplicates of already existing ones. DefectDojo handles this for us, 
let us try it out:

1. At first, make sure to activate 
[De-Duplication in DefectDojo](https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/usage/features/#global-configuration):
In your DefectDojo instance, click on the settings symbol in the menu bar at the left. Select *Systems Settings*. 
Next, tick the checkbox next to *Deduplicate findings*. 
![defectdojo-deduplication](/img/docs/how-tos/dd-deduplicate.png)

2. Let us now verify that if we run an identical scan again, the amount of active findings does not change.

Delete the scan from before in kubernetes. Note that this does not affect DefectDojo.
```bash
kubectl delete scan nmap-scanme.nmap.org -n scanning
```
Re-apply it via kubectl:
```bash
kubectl apply -f scan.yaml -n scanning 
```

After scan and DefectDojo hook have finished, check again your local DefectDojo instance. There should not be
any new *Active Findings*. You can still find the duplicates under *Findings -> View All Findings*.

### Advanced use-case: Hook annotations

It is possible to overwrite the 
[default values](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/defectdojo#additional-chart-configurations) 
that the DefectDojo hook uses to create products and engagements.
This is especially handy when using the *secureCodeBox* 
[Autodiscovery](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/autodiscovery) or 
[CascadingScans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/cascading-rule) to annotate your scans with useful
names and to keep track of their origin. For the Autodiscovery, there are already pre-defined values that can be found
[here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/blob/main/auto-discovery/kubernetes/values.yaml#L40).

To get you started with a simple example, we will now create an annotation in a manually executed scan. 
Create the following file:
```yaml
# scanAnnotation.yaml
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: the secureCodeBox authors
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "nmap-scanme.nmap.org-annotation"
  annotations:
    defectdojo.securecodebox.io/product-name: "Annotation Example"
spec:
  scanType: "nmap"
  parameters:
    - scanme.nmap.org
```

Execute it via kubectl:
```bash
kubectl apply -n scanning -f scanAnnotation.yaml
```

After a while you should see a new engagement in your DefectDojo instance with product name `Annotation Example`.

## ElasticSearch

[ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/de/elasticsearch/) enables users to store and search pretty much any possible 
kind of data. [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/de/kibana/) provides a graphical user interface to easily access the data
stored in ElasticSearch. Using them in combination with the *secureCodeBox* is simpler than using DefectDojo, as
the [persistence-elastic hook](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/elasticsearch) comes with 
a ready-to-use ElasticSearch and Kibana instance.

### Setup

At first, we create a cluster and the *secureCodeBox* namespace and operator:
```bash
minikube start

kubectl create namespace securecodebox-system
helm --namespace securecodebox-system upgrade --install securecodebox-operator secureCodeBox/operator
```

Next, we simply install an exemplary scanner and the *persistence-elastic* hook. Note that Kibana is enabled by default.
```bash
# Scanner and ElasticSearch should be in the same namespace
kubectl create namespace elastic
helm --namespace elastic upgrade --install nmap secureCodeBox/nmap
helm --namespace elastic upgrade --install persistence-elastic secureCodeBox/persistence-elastic
```

That's it! Let us run an example scan (same as above for DefectDojo):
```yaml
# scan.yaml
# SPDX-FileCopyrightText: the secureCodeBox authors
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0

apiVersion: "execution.securecodebox.io/v1"
kind: Scan
metadata:
  name: "nmap-scanme.nmap.org"
spec:
  scanType: "nmap"
  parameters:
    - scanme.nmap.org
```

Apply it via kubectl:
```bash
kubectl apply -n elastic -f scan.yaml
```

After the scan has finished, you can view the findings in Kibana. Create a port-forward:
```bash
kubectl port-forward -n elastic services/persistence-elastic-kibana 5601:5601
```

You can now go to [localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) and access your data in the Kibana instance!

### Managing findings via the secureCodeBox and Kibana

Note that unlike DefectDojo, ElasticSearch does not automatically handle duplicated findings. However, you can find 
pre-defined dashboards for some scanners implemented in the *secureCodeBox*, which makes visualizing their results
straight-forward. You can find a list of all available dashboards under 
[/app/dashboards#/list](http://localhost:5601/app/dashboards#/list) in your local Kibana instance.

### Using DefectDojo and ElasticSearch simultaneously

It is possible to use DefectDojo and ElasticSearch at the same time. 
[Note that DefectDojo overwrites the findings of the SCB with its own format by default](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/blob/83088ca4a51b76ab15c88510f1f52877ab08fd9c/hooks/persistence-defectdojo/values.yaml#L43).
So when using multiple persistence providers, hook execution order does matter. The problem can be solved in two
ways: Either use the [hook order functionality](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/how-tos/hooks/#hook-order) or
set DefectDojo to [read-only mode](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/hooks/defectdojo/#read-only-mode).


## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>
Connecting the SCB to a persistence provider, especially DefectDojo, can sometimes be a bit tricky. 
The following tips might help in case that something went wrong:
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li> <b>Waiting:</b> It takes some time for the DefectDojo or Kibana instance to come up. You might also have to refresh 
several times in order to connect to localhost after the port-forward.
</li>
<li> <b>Verbose logging:</b> You can view verbose output for everything in your cluster, 
for example via <a href="https://github.com/wercker/stern">stern</a>. 
For the following steps, 
you have to have <a href="https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/#bash">krew</a> installed:
<br />
<code>
kubectl krew install stern <br />
# View all logs in default namespace: <br />
kubectl stern .* <br />
# View for a specific namespace <br />
kubectl stern .* --namespace scanning
</code>
</li>
<li> <b>Re-Installation of DefectDojo:</b> Node that if anything went wrong, and you have to re-install 
DefectDojo in the cluster, the <i>createSecret</i> flags in the values.yaml file of DefectDojo must not be set. 
You can find more 
details <a href="https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/dev/readme-docs/KUBERNETES.md#re-install-the-chart">here</a>.
</li>
<li> <b>Server error in DefectDojo</b>: Make sure that all pods are running. If you are continuing to experience errors
after a re-installation, consider to use a different cluster manager (e.g. kind instead of minikube).
</li>
<li> <b>Using a local instance of DefectDojo rather than Kubernetes</b>: If nothing helps, you still have the option
to run DefectDojo outside 
your cluster (instructions <a href="https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo#quick-start">here</a>). After that,
you can connect the DefectDojo hook treating it like a <i>remote</i> instance of DefectDojo. The helm install command
for the hook would look like this: <br />
<code>
# $YOURLOCALIP should look something like http://192.168.2.242:8080 <br />
helm upgrade --install persistence-defectdojo secureCodeBox/persistence-defectdojo \ <br />
    --set="defectdojo.url=$YOURLOCALIP"
</code>
</li>
<li> <b>Increasing cluster resources</b>: Running a lot of pods at the same time can be resource-intensive. If you
find that your persistence providers are not reacting in appropriate time, you might want to increase the number of
cpus and memory usage for your minikube cluster: <br />
<code>
# If you already created a cluster, you most likely have to delete it at first <br />
minikube stop <br />
minikube delete <br />
# Create a new cluster with more resources <br />
minikube start --memory 8192 --cpus 4
</code>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
