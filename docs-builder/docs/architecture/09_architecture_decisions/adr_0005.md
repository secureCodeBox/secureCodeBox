Deprecated since we did some optimizations by marketing specialists some months ago.

## Context

As our requirements about our homepage changed we no longer just want to give a simple overview about our project on our landing page as we did with our GatsbyJS based website, but furthermore we require a marketing oriented webpage additionally to our documentation site (for more on that see [???](#ADR-0004)). This marketing page should satisfy following aspects:

- Modern, ideally timeless, design
- Overview about the secureCodeBox
- Display of our projectâ€™s advantages
- Offer for service (prizing)
- Encouragement for contacting us
- Encouragement for contributing

## Decision

Since there is no arguable reason to build such a one-pager ourselves, we should buy a ready to go solution for us. We are not aiming to invest extensive time neither in building such a page, nor in gaining the desired design and marketing expertise, and also not hiring experts on this field (all this would actually be more expensive and time consuming than buying a site). Some stores for such pages are:

- <https://www.templatemonster.com/>
- <https://onepagelove.com/templates>
- <https://themeforest.net/tags/onepage>

## Consequences

If we want to change the style or design someday, we probably could not reuse the bought template if it is not a minor change, thus would need to buy another template. We also would have to orient the presentation of the secureCodeBox around the template we decide on, but nowadays we have a ginormous variety to choose from.
