# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Our _release cycle_ for new features (minor [semver](https://semver.org/) update)
is roughly every two weeks (we will usually make a new release after each review).

| Version | Security Fixes* | Supported** |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 5.x.x | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
| 4.16.x | Critical issues only | :x: |
| <= 3.15.x | :x: | :x: |

### Major Release (Semver)

_Upcoming major updates_ will come with a time window in which both _major versions_ (starting with v2.x.x)
will receive security updates and bugfixes. The concrete support interval will probably be a couple of months
and will be published when the next major version is released.

### Minor Release/Feature Releases (Semver)

We currently plan to provide support for the _latest minor [semver](https://semver.org/)_ release only.

### Patch Release/Bugfix/Security Fix

We try to make bugfixes and high severity fixes available as patch release for the current minor release
as early as possible.

## Extended (Enterprise) Support

If you are interested in extended support for older versions with security updates of our project
please get in touch with the project team via Slack or email <secureCodeBox@iteratec.com>.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You have found a vulnerability in the project that shouldn't be disclosed as a public issue before it's fixed?
Please report it using GitHub Security Advisories at https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/security/advisories.

If you are unable to use GitHub advisories, please email the project leaders at their OWASP email addresses that can be found under https://github.com/OWASP/www-project-securecodebox/blob/master/leaders.md.

You can expect a fast reaction within the next few days.
We will keep you updated about the next steps and inform you if the vulnerability is accepted and when it's fixed or if it's declined somehow.
