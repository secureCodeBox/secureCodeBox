## Steps to implement a new scanner
<!--
Hint: A general guide how to implement a new scanner is documented [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/docs/developer-guide)
-->

- [ ] Create a new folder with the name of the [scanner here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/scanners)
- [ ] Add a README.md and give a brief overview of the scanner and its configuration options.
- [ ] Implement a new scanner specific scan-type.yaml
- [ ] Implement a new scanner specific parse-definition.yaml
- [ ] Add (optional) some cascading-rules.yaml
- [ ] Add (optional) a Dockerfile for the scanner if there is no existing one publicly available on dockerHub
- [ ] Use the [parser-SDK](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/parser-sdk) to implement a new findings parser (currently based on NodeJS)
- [ ] Add unit tests with at minimum 80% test coverage
