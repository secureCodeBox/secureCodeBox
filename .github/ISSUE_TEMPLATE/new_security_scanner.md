## Steps to implement a new scanner
Hint: A general guide how to implement a new SCB scanner is documented [here](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-scanner)

- [ ] Create a new Helm Chart with the `make create-new-scanner NAME=new-scanner` command in the project directory (replace `new-scanner` with the name of the scanner)
- [ ] Add a basic description of your scanner Helm chart in the `Chart.yaml`
- [ ] (optional) Add/Edit fields in `values.yaml`
- [ ] (optional) Add some cascading rules, see [here](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/api/crds/cascading-rule/)
- [ ] Add (optional) a `Dockerfile` for the scanner if there is no existing one publicly available on DockerHub in the `scanner` directory
- [ ] Use the [parser-SDK](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/parser-sdk) to implement a new findings parser (currently based on NodeJS) in the `parser` directory
- [ ] Add unit tests with at minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] Add some example `scan.yaml` and `finding.yaml` files in the [example folder](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-scanner/examples-dir)
- [ ] Implement a [new integration or E2E test](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-scanner/integration-tests) for the hook [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/tests/integration)
- [ ] Add a brief overview of the scanner and its configuration options in `.helm-docs.gotmpl`
