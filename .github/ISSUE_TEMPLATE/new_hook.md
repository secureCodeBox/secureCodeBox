## Steps to implement a new Hook
<!--
Hint: A general guide how to implement a new scanner is documented [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/docs/developer-guide)
-->

- [ ] Create a new folder with the name of the [hook here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/hooks)
- [ ] Add a README and give a brief overview of the scanner and its configuration options.
- [ ] Add (optional) a Dockerfile for the scanner if there is no existing one publicly available on dockerHub
- [ ] Use the [Hook-SDK](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/hook-sdk) to implement a new hook (currently based on NodeJS)
- [ ] Add unit tests with at minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] Add some example scan.yaml and finding.yaml files in the example folder
- [ ] Implement a new integration test for the hook [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/tests/integration)
