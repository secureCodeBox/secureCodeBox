## Steps to implement a new Hook
<!--
Hint: A general guide how to implement a new scanner is documented [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox-v2/tree/master/docs/developer-guide)
-->

- [ ] Create a new folder with the name of the [scanner here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox-v2/tree/master/scanners), based on the existing template
- [ ] Add a README.md and give a brief overview of the scanner and its configuration options.
- [ ] Implement a new scanner specific scan-type.yaml
- [ ] Implement a new scanner specific parse-definition.yaml
- [ ] Add (optional) some cascading-rules.yaml
- [ ] Add (optional) a Dockerfile for the scanner if there is now existing one public available on dockerHub
- [ ] Use the parserSDK to implement a new findings parser (currently based on NodeJS)
- [ ] Add unit tests with at minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] Add some example scan.yaml and finding.yaml files in the example folder
- [ ] Implement a new integration test for the scanner [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox-v2/tree/master/tests/integration)
