## Steps to implement a new hook
Hint: A general guide how to implement a new SCB Hook is documented [here](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-hook)

- [ ] Create a new folder with the name of the [hook here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/hooks)
- [ ] Add a `README.md` and give a brief overview of the scanner and its configuration options.
- [ ] Add a HelmChart and document all configuration options.
- [ ] Add (optional) a `Dockerfile` for the scanner if there is no existing one publicly available on dockerHub.io
- [ ] Use the [Hook-SDK](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/hook-sdk) to implement a new hook (currently based on NodeJS)
- [ ] Add unit tests with at minimum 80% test coverage
- [ ] Add some example `scan.yaml` and `finding.yaml` files in the example folder
- [ ] Implement a [new integration or E2E test](https://docs.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-hook/integration-tests) for the hook [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/tests/integration)
