## Steps to implement a new hook
Hint: A general guide how to implement a new SCB Hook is documented [here](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-hook)

- [ ] Create a new Helm Chart with the `helm create new-hook` command in the `hooks` directory (replace `new-hook` with the name of the hook)
- [ ] Add a basic description of your hook Helm chart in the `Chart.yaml`
- [ ] (optional) Add/Edit fields in `values.yaml`
- [ ] Add (optional) a `Dockerfile` for the hook if you do not use the provided [hook-sdk](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/hook-sdk/nodejs)
- [ ] Implement the hook in `hook.js` and test it in `hook.test.js`
- [ ] Implement a [new integration or E2E test](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/contributing/integrating-a-hook/integration-tests) for the hook [here](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/master/tests/integration)
- [ ] Add a brief overview of the scanner and its configuration options in `.helm-docs.gotmpl`
