  What are you not allowed to do with Content?

  We refer to these as Prohibited Uses which include:
  âœ•	You cannot sell or distribute Content (either in digital or physical form) on a Standalone basis. Standalone means where no creative effort has been applied to the Content and it remains in substantially the same form as it exists on our website.
